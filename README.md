# Usage
Run `bypass.ps1` and let the script do its thing.

# Notes
You may need to set the Powershell execution policy to `Unrestricted`, if you\'ve never tried to run a Powershell script before.
Simply open up a Powershell terminal, and enter `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`.

You may also need to install `Left 4 Dead 2 Authoring Tools` from Steam, or modify the VPK path to point to a `vpk.exe` file.
